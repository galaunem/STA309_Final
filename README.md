## Key Findings

### Logistic Regression Model:
- Accuracy: 0.90
- This model included all 8 predictors and served as a baseline for comparsion.

### Random Forest Model:
- Accuracy: 0.91

- Chosen for its simplicity. This model provided a clear visulatization for predciting diabetes.

## Data CLeaning
- Converted categorical variables to factors for analysis.
- Ensured all missing values were handled appropriately.

## Conclusion.
The Random Forest model performed the best in terms of accuracy.
